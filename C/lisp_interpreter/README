This is a personal project in progress. This project started on November 1, 2023.
I spend about 30 minutes per day working on it.

All of the code is in a single file. Yes, it will be broken into header and source files when I refactor it,
but as this is a personal project with no collaborators and with no intention of applying it to any project,
I am keeping all of the code in a single file until I hit my first milestone: getting it work. Until then,
I expect many radical changes, as it is exploratory. Rather than refactor, over and over, I've decided to
keep it all together until that point in time.

The goal is to create a simple Lisp Interpreter in C as a means to study various concepts in practice, such as
garbage collectors, LISP architecture, etc.

I chose the C language simply to display my C skills. The project would be easier to carry out in C++ and very
easy to carry out in C#, Java, Python, or another high level object oriented language with garbage collection.
However, that would obscure exactly what I am exploring.
